# TODO LIST

- [ ] "Select" multiple images on the home page and do action that affects all of them (delete multiple, add multiple to albums)
- [ ] "Infinite scroll" (display only enough to view, fetch more as scrolling)
- [ ] Folfers/Albums
- [ ] Shared albums (multiple users can have access to one albums)
- [ ] Customized permissions (original album creator can upload/delete, guests can only view, or can upload/view, etc.)
